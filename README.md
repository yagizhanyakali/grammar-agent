   # Move the 4 PNG files to the icons/ folder
   ```

2. **Load Extension**:

   - Click "Save"

## Usage

1. **Click the extension icon** to open the popup
2. **Enter your OpenAI API key** (first time only) and click "Save"
3. **Paste or type your text** in the input area
4. **Click "Correct Grammar"** button

### Example

**Input:**
```
This are a example text with some grammar error. I has been working on this project for long time and want to make sure the grammer is correct.

This is an example text with some grammar errors. I have been working on this project for a long time and want to make sure the grammar is correct.
```

## How It Works

1. You paste text into the extension popup
2. The extension sends your text + grammar correction prompt to OpenAI API
3. OpenAI returns the corrected text
4. You see the result and can copy it

**Important:** The text is sent to OpenAI's API for processing. Your text is NOT stored by this extension, but OpenAI processes it according to their [privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

## Grammar Correction Prompt

The extension uses this prompt template:

```
You are a professional grammar correction assistant. Your task is to:

1. Correct all grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors
2. Improve sentence structure and clarity
3. Maintain the original meaning and tone
4. Keep the same language as the input text

Please correct the following text and return ONLY the corrected version without any explanations or additional comments:
```

You can modify this prompt in `popup.js` if you want different behavior.

Check [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for current rates.

## Troubleshooting

### "Please save your OpenAI API key first"

**Solution**: Enter your API key in the top field and click "Save". Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### "Invalid API key"

**Solution**: Make sure your API key:
- Starts with "sk-"
- Is copied correctly without extra spaces
- Is active and has available credits

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution**: You've sent too many requests. Wait a minute and try again. OpenAI has rate limits based on your account tier.

### "Quota exceeded"

**Solution**: Your OpenAI account has run out of credits. Add credits to your account at [OpenAI Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing).

### Icons not showing

**Solution**: 
1. Open `icons/generate_icons.html` in your browser
2. Click "Download All Icons"
3. Move all 4 PNG files to the `icons/` folder
4. Reload the extension

## Development

### Customize the Prompt

Edit the `GRAMMAR_CORRECTION_PROMPT` constant in `popup.js`:

```javascript
const GRAMMAR_CORRECTION_PROMPT = `Your custom prompt here...`;
```

### Change the AI Model

In `popup.js`, find the `callOpenAI` function and change the model:

```javascript
model: 'gpt-4', // Change from 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

Available models:
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fastest, cheapest (recommended)
- `gpt-4` - More capable, slower, more expensive
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Balance of speed and capability

### Adjust AI Behavior

Modify the `temperature` parameter in `popup.js`:

```javascript
temperature: 0.3, // 0 = deterministic, 1 = creative
```

Lower temperature (0-0.3) = More consistent corrections  
Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) = More creative rewrites

## Limitations

- Requires internet connection
- Requires OpenAI API key with credits
- Maximum ~2000 tokens per request (adjust `max_tokens` in code if needed)
- Text is sent to OpenAI for processing
- Response time depends on OpenAI API speed (~2-5 seconds)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for multiple AI providers (Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- [ ] Custom prompt templates
- [ ] History of corrections (opt-in)
- [ ] Batch correction for multiple texts
- [ ] Language detection and selection
- [ ] Style presets (formal, casual, academic)
- [ ] Diff view showing changes
- [ ] Export corrected text to file
